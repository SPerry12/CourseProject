# Overview
The purpose behind this project is to create a recipe sharing application that will enable users to share their person recipes. The application should allow users to share their recipes, but also allow them to 
keep their recipes private in their own personal digital cookbook. The application should also have the option to share with specific people such as friends. Users should also have the ability to rate other “Chefs” 
and their individual recipes. The application also needs to provide the ability to share their recipes to outside social media sites. 

Users should also be able to make unique searches when looking through public recipes. This should be enabled by allowing users to utilize pre-existing tags to label their recipes when publishing their recipes. 
The ability to compare recipes side-by-side in one window is also a function that we are requesting. Users should also be able to comment on each recipe. There also needs to be a function where users can “link” their 
public recipes to other public recipes of a similar nature and their visibility will be based on their rating.   

The users should be able to provide a significant amount of information within their recipes to include, but not limited to a generous amount of space to provide recipe instructions, images of their recipes and nutritional 
information. These three attributes should not be provided in one space, but be separated in the application.  

# Key Functions

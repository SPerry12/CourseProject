# CookBookPlus

CookBookPlus was my first ever web application built in ASP.NET Core. In a sense this application is a digital cookbook that allows a user to create and save recipes to their profile.

The original plan for this project was to implement a system where users could rate and comment on recipes and chefs in addition to the ability to create/save recipes.
